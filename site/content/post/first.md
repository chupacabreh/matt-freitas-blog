As a teenager, Geocities and Angelfire websites were the go to for budding web designers to express themselves on a rapidly changing frontier of world wide web. A digital manifest destiny, so to speak.

I had a passion for online gaming; it was new and exciting. The idea that I could take a computer game and connect to others over the phone line while playing with or against one another boggled my mind and excited me to no end.

I created my first websites based on games like Final Fantasy VII for the PlayStation, Quake and Unreal Tournament for the PC. I was heavily active in the online community that surrounded these games. Clans, competitive play, daily news sites, mods and new maps-- a literal virtual world right at my disposal. My first "serious" website was called Bot Lair. I found it on the web archive here:

It was a semi-daily news site dedicated specifically around artificial opponents known as bots that could be used in a multiplayer setting without actually going online. Essentially they took on the role of human competitors during online play.

I was about 16 when I made Bot Lair. I hand coded everything, though it was nothing too complicated. I was hosted by a popular gaming website (Quake2.com) and it had a small and dedicated following. That was my first foray into actually creating content for the web. I truly loved it. Though, for some reason, I always had the notion that it wasn't something I could do for an actual living. I toyed with the idea of studying computer science in school but I didn't have the confidence as a teenager to actually pursue it. I would often think to myself that I was too inept at math and science to even attempt such an endeavor. So life took me on another path and I ended up joining the military.

Four years in the service and a slew of jobs later, I found myself at Bloc. Recently I stumbled upon the DIY coding movement that had been budding online. Not only was it possible to learn to program on your computer but there also existed a slew of resources and online support to provide the foundation. I found out companies hired developers without computer science degrees! After dabbling with treehouse and codeacademy, I decided to take the next step and enroll in Bloc. So my journey begins.
